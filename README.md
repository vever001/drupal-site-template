# OpenEuropa template for Drupal 8 projects

[![Build Status](https://drone.fpfis.eu/api/badges/openeuropa/drupal-site-template/status.svg?branch=master)](https://drone.fpfis.eu/openeuropa/drupal-site-template)

**Please note:** this repository contains code that is necessary to generate
a new Drupal 8 project, please read carefully the [Start a new project](#start-a-new-project)
section below before proceeding.

You need to have the following software installed on your local development environment:

* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md#installation-linux-unix-osx)
* [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
* PHP 7.1 or greater (only needed during project creation)

## Start a new project

To create a new Drupal 8 project run the following command:

```bash
composer create-project vever001/drupal-site-template --stability=dev <dg-name>-<project-id>-reference
```

This will download the starterkit into the `<dg-name>-<project-id>-reference` folder and a
wizard will ask you for the project name and your organisation. It will use this
information to personalize your project's configuration files.

The installer will then download all dependencies for the project. This process
takes several minutes. At the end you will be asked whether to remove the
existing version history. It is recommended to confirm this question so that you
can start your project with a clean slate.

The following steps to get your new site up and running can be found in the
`README.md` inside your newly created project folder.
